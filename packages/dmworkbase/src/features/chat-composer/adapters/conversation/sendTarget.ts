/**
 * Reply / edit target capture for the send path (octo-web#1280).
 *
 * `Conversation.onSend` used to read `vm.currentReplyMessage` /
 * `vm.currentHandlerType` at the moment it ran. Once sends are queued that read
 * can happen seconds later, after the user picked another reply target or
 * switched to "edit message" — a queued send could then reply to the wrong
 * message or, worse, overwrite an unrelated one via `editMessage`.
 *
 * The target is therefore taken out of the view model synchronously when the
 * composer consumes its compose (which also hides the reply/edit banner, so the
 * UI stops inviting a change that can no longer apply), travels with that
 * compose, and is put back if the send never got enqueued so a retry still
 * edits/replies to the original message.
