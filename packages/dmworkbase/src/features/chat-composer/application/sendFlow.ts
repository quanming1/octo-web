/**
 * Send-flow orchestration helper (octo-web#227 → octo-web#1280).
 *
 * ## History — three rounds of send-side bugs
 *
 * 1. (#227 round 1) `MessageInput.send()` called `props.onSend(...)` (typed
 *    `=> void`, never awaited) and then, in the *same synchronous frame*,
 *    unconditionally cleared the editor, deleted pasted-image `File` refs,
 *    revoked preview URLs and cleared the top-attachment area. For the mixed
 *    text+image path `onSend` is async and only fails after an upload, so the
 *    compose state was destroyed before the failure was known — one failed
 *    upload wiped the whole draft with nothing to retry.
 *    Fix: make the contract awaitable and clean up only after the send settles.
 *
 * 2. (#227 round 2) Awaiting the send left the editor editable during the wait.
 *    `Conversation.onSend` can take seconds (upload + ack). If the user started
 *    the next message while the first was pending, the older send's success
 *    cleared the *current* (newer) editor — wiping the new draft.
 *    Fix at the time: snapshot-aware cleanup — clear the editor only when it
 *    still held exactly what was sent, otherwise leave everything alone.
 *
 * 3. (#1280 — this round) The round-2 fix was all-or-nothing, and its own
 *    "known residual edge case" became the top user complaint: when the user
 *    keeps typing / pasting while a send is in flight (the normal "send several
 *    images in a row" flow), the *already sent* content is left in the composer
 *    forever. The message is visible in the history, so the composer looks
 *    broken ("nothing was sent"), and pressing send again re-sends it.
 *    Two other defects piled onto the same symptom:
 *      • `MessageInput` had a re-entrancy guard that silently dropped any send
 *        issued while another was pending — the 2nd/3rd Enter did nothing;
 *      • `Conversation` reported an ack timeout as *failure*, so a slow network
 *        pushed already-delivered content back into the composer.
 *
 * ## Current model: consume-first, restore-on-failure
 *
 * The composer is consumed **synchronously** when the send starts (editor
 * cleared, consumed top attachments removed) and the compose payload is
 * captured. Nothing about the composer is decided after the await, so the whole
 * "did the document change while we waited?" race disappears:
 *
 *   - success → nothing to clean in the UI; only in-memory `File` refs and
 *     preview object URLs of the consumed compose are disposed;
 *   - failure → the captured compose is restored (editor content re-inserted
 *     *before* whatever the user typed meanwhile, top attachments re-added), so
 *     the round-1 "failed upload wiped the draft" protection is preserved and
 *     the round-2 "newer draft wiped" protection holds by construction.
 *
 * Sends are serialized through {@link createSendQueue} instead of being dropped:
 * each send captures its payload immediately and runs after the previous one, so
 * message ordering (which `Conversation` guarantees by awaiting ack) is kept
 * while rapid consecutive sends all go out.
 *
 * `onSend` always returns a complete `ChatSendOutcome`. Boolean and void
 * results are intentionally rejected at this internal boundary: every caller
 * must declare consumed attachments, unsent editor blocks and target restore
 * behavior explicitly. A thrown error still restores the whole compose.
 *
 * NOTE for `onSend` implementors: "consumed" means *the message was enqueued and
 * is visible in the message list* — not "the server acked it". A message that is
 * enqueued and later fails renders a failure marker with resend, so its outcome
 * must keep `editorConsumed` true.
