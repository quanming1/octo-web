// Build the Markdown body of a "forward document to chat" message (feature #511):

// #511 review blocker: `messageTitle` is the live document title, which is
// user-controlled, and it used to be interpolated raw into both the bold run and
// the link label. A title containing `] [ ) * \` or a line break could break out
// of the card structure — forging a misleading link or tampering with the rendered
// message. (This is structural forgery, not XSS: rehype-sanitize already strips
// scripts.) So we escape the title for the text / link-label context and wrap +
// escape the URL destination before assembling the message.

// Markdown-significant characters that must be neutralised inside inline text and
// link labels so they render literally instead of as syntax.

/**
 * Assemble the forwarded-doc message body: a bold title line followed by a link

 *
 * #511 problem 1 (option A, boss-approved): the recipient must be able to *see*
 * the true destination URL on the card and click it, not just a title-labelled
 * anchor that hides the URL behind the `href`. So the link label is the real URL
 * (host + path + query), which stays clickable to the same destination and remains
 * complete in visible text so selecting/copying the rendered message preserves the
 * full URL. The bold title is retained on the line above.
 *
 * The URL is app-generated (buildDocLink) and carries no Markdown-structural
 * characters, so it is safe to use verbatim as the link label; only the
 * user-controlled title is escaped. The destination is still angle-bracket wrapped
 * and escaped so a title-adjacent edge case cannot break out of the link.
