// `token{sid}` bucket in localStorage, so the sid-keyed `WKApp.loginInfo.load()` reads nothing on
// such a cold-load even though the user is signed in — every request then 401s. This mirrors the
// recovery the invite-landing path has always done: scan localStorage for the first stored
// session and adopt it, so the deep-link authenticates against the real session instead of
// bouncing to a sign-in wall (AC-3).
//
// Kept as a pure function over a Storage-like object (not reading the WKApp singleton) so the
// scan logic is unit-testable without a live host.
